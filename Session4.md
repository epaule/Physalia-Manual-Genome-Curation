# Hands-on Manual Genome Curation Physalia course - Day 4

**Session 4: Challenging genomes to curate and strategies to deal with them**

Please find slides for Manual Genome Curation overview and Asssembly Metrics at [Session_4_Challenging_genomes_Sex_chroms.pdf](docs/Session_4_Challenging_genomes_Sex_chroms.pdf).

Please download the data we are going to use in this session, as follows:


```
wget https://asg_hubs.cog.sanger.ac.uk/physalia_workshop/Day_4.tar.xz
```

Then:

```
tar xvfJ Day_4.tar.xz
```


## For this session, we will focus on challenging genomes.


Give it a try:

-ddHypPerf1: polyploid plant
-ilEreMont1: looks to be a straitforward lepidoptera, but you may find an interesting evolutionary feature on this one.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> At the end of the curation process, check if you:
> 1. Made all the necessary rearrangements in the map
> 2. Added metadata
> 3. Painted chromosomes
> 4. Generated AGP file

## Generating the curated fasta file

Have a look at Session3.2 to check how to generate the curated fasta files.
